### Description
An application similar to NextDoor and MyRaft’s feed function, but for on campus housing. Users can post or read posts in categories of general, lost and found, or for sale. They can also complete roommate matching (which will be similar to a dating profile).

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app is developed for mobile first, but could be extended to a desktop version.
- **Story:** Users can connect with others living in CSUMB’s dorms in order to find lost goods, buy unused items, or find potential roommates.
- **Market:** An individual with a csumb email can sign up for this app. They also have to agree to community guidelines before signing up.
- **Habit:** This app could be used daily or as needed. Because it serves essential functions for students living on campus and new posts pop up every day they will be attracted to return to the app. In the future settings could alert them when there is a new post or someone likes their roommate profile.
- **Scope:** First we would start with an app where users can post or read posts in categories of general, lost and found, or for sale. Additionally, they can complete roommate matching. Later a chat feature could be added as well as integration with CSUMB’s housing portal or ways to report/submit work orders for campus housing.
